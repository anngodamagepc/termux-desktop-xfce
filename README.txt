| Description

In the android icon that you see below in the panel, that is
the menu, press it to open it, then you will see some icons,
are a few apps that I pinned to the panel, among them the
xfce4 terminal, text editor, video player,
settings and other things.

after you will see the apps menu, with which you can
manage the applications that you have open.

later you will see 2 squares, and one of them is green,
with that you can change desk and manage your spaces
of work.

then there are some utilities, including a button to
minimize all open windows, a manager
clipboard, notification center, sound settings,
status of your internet connection (to see details you need
have the termux-api app installed). You will also see 
the clock and the buttons to close the desktop.

| Topics

In xfwm4, appareance, and mouse and touch pad settings
you can change cursor themes, icons, gtk, Qt, and others
more things

To get the full screen desktop, go to:

Settings>display

And change the resolution to that of your phone, you can use
the application "cpu-z" in the play store to know

this is not necessary in termux Wayland.
